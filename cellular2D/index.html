    <h4>Testing percolation without fire and tree dynamics</h4>
    <p>
      A first way to test percolation is to set random fire probability and tree growth to 0, and resetting the tree density to the desired value (with the button).
      <br />
      Then we can either left-click on the canvas or click on the "Force random fire" button to start a fire and see whether or not the whole forest died.
      <br />
      As expected we get different results depending on whether the Von Neumann or Moore neighborhood is used.
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li><b>Von neumann: </b>d ≈ 0.55</li>
        <li><b>Moore: </b>d ≈ 0.40</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Percolation with fire and tree dynamics</h4>
    <p>
      When fire and tree dynamics is activated (i.e the probability of fire & tree growth > 0) the tree density cycles over time between a near 0 value
      and the percolation value discussed in the last paragraph.
